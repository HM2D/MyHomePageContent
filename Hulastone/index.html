                My name is <i>Hooman</i> (Persian:هومن). i was born in Iran, Bushehr, <mark><a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bandar+Ganaveh,+Bushehr+Province/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x3fb65cce55bcfdc1:0xb6499d493f69a74b?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjVxaq33YfXAhUBI1AKHaNtD4sQ8gEIKDAA">Bandar Genaveh</a></mark>. A small city by the Persian Gulf, popular for it's beautiful beach and markets. I currently live in Fars, <mark><a target="_blank" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Shiraz,+Fars+Province/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x3fb20d0c8c85f2e3:0x6d0c5b8aef6b4cf6?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiM0Mz83IfXAhXNZlAKHV_KBaEQ8gEIJTAA" >Shiraz</a></mark>. My Nickname is <b>HM2D</b> but since it's hard to call out my friends call me <b>Hu</b> (/'Hjuː/). Used to study marine engineering (bachelor) in Persian Gulf University at first but after 3 semesters i changed my major to Software Engineering which was the best decision in my life since i had a lot of experience with computers even back then but for some reasons got mixed in marine engineering. After the next semester i requested a transfer to shiraz university due to my mother's mental state. Shiraz universitie's condition for my approval as a student was to score a GPA of 15/20 or higher in 3 coming semesters, which i passed.
                </p><p>
I currently have bachelor of science degree in software engineering from <mark><a target="_blank" href="https://shirazu.ac.ir">Shiraz University</a></mark> (formerly known as Pahlavi University)  and i plan to apply for  Game Development graduate program in US. I'm hoping to find a professional career in Game Industry and be part of something big. Been my goal ever since i got addicted to my Sega genesis! It's wrong to persue it here cause of the limitations my country brings in this area and other.

                <p> Mosly may not be considered as a skill, but the experience i have and gained through video games in my own conceptual world is considered a skill. There is a diffrence between a noob and a pro. Don't we all gamers know that? I've been a gamer ever since i first played WWF Raw(SEGA). And so with the generations i moved on to PSX, PS2, PSP, XBOX360, XBOX ONE and PC was included the whole time. I don't have the records for my gaming experience before the 7th generation since i never tried online gameplay in the 6th or before. But my profiles after the 6th gen are visible at the top of the page and they indicate all my experience.</p>
                <p> The game that i'm best at and have been persuing professionaly is Gears of war franchise. I'm a diamond rank player with a mlg rank, not a good one since the latency with the servers are high and the internet quality in a 3rd world country is really poor so it's mostly frustrating to play with a latency of 170-200ms.</p> 
                <p>I've been an Author at <a style="color:orange" target="_blank" href="https://www.cheathappens.com/user_profile.asp?userID=699389">Cheathappens.com</a> since 2010 and it's the only forum i've ever been active in but not so much recently. The game community back then was amazing and it was a great help to my english and writing. Used to make trainers for my games with Cheat Engine which i learned from this website.
                    </p>
                <p> I'm also <b>Co-Founder of Electronic Sports League</b>(ESL) in <b>Shiraz University</b>(2015-2016).Since it was the first for Shiraz University we had many difficulties along the way but the attention and community of gamers we founded that year really worth it. The first ESL's participants were about 200 exclusively students of ShirazU but the second year they reached <b>800</b> players and that was due to the co-operation of other universities in Shiraz. First year was he ld only for Video games and only on PC but we hosted board games too in second year. First year's leagues were Counter-Strike (Teams of 5), Generals, FIFA 14, PES 2014, Call of Duty:MW (Teams of 5), Dota 2. I participated in Counter-Strike but we got the second position! For the second year we added Dota 1, updated PES to 2016, Daliz, Otello, the last two are board games. Second year went better since we had a bigger team and better support from the university faculty. We had more sites and room for our exhibits. The next ESL league is being planned for. the sites are already reserved and we are planning on the preprations and we are hoping to raech more patricipants than before.</p>

                <p> I started learning Unity 5(2D) in 2015 with making couple of prototypes, which you can find the project files <a href="#">here</a>. Since i'm a multiplayer fan, i tried learning HLAPI and started the project Enchanted Forest multiplayer(LAN only). An Old board game we used to play when we were kids. Since my friend who was going to work on the graphic design part of the game failed to hold his promise the project was delayed for a long time, but i never gave up on it since it took many months of my life. I recently have published it. I also have one official and one unofficial apps made with unity. Official one is called Clash Royal's DeckBuilder and is currently in Google Play Store and Bazaar(Android App Store in Iran) which reached 1000+ installs. You can find the Details <a hre="#">here</a>. Being indie and alone is almost impossible if you are wishing for a good career in this area. And even more when you are limited so much by your country. We can't even access Unity's documents because of the restrictions. </p>
                <p>Making video games actually feels like playing, challenges are the bugs and the functions you want it to do, respawning is where you gotta try over and over to fix the bugs, you pass the level when your code works. Aside from gaming this is the only work i do that makes me so focused that i can't hear anyone and time just flies. I haven't been active in this area since i just finished my bachelor and my only plan is to get admission for a graduate program in Game Development. </p><br><br><br>
